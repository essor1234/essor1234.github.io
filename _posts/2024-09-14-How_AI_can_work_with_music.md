# How AI can change way we learn instrument
I love playing piano, and at the start of my music journey, I met many tough situations like I didn't know how to play a note, or what that piece of music sounded like...
That is why an AI tool that can read a sheet of music, and then generate the sound from that sheet is essential for the journey of a piano beginner, especially for kids. This helps create a fascination for them and motivates them to achieve harder and harder pieces of music. And how do I know this?
In my own experience, when I practice a piece of music over and over again but still can not play it right, I feel exhausted when the piece still feels like trash, and that is when I feel like I need someone to actually play that piece for me so I can absorb the emotion that the piece brings to me.

## Is it possible??
Of course, it is possible, and I will make one no matter what it costs me. I have several ideas and thinking about this already, and I am trying to achieve it. I am serious about this so I gonna choose it for my final year project. If I fail, I'm gonna die :)))

## How can I do it?
I will discuss this later on, when I sign up for this project, and become serious about this.
